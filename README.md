[Neural Cellular Maze Solver](https://umu1729.github.io/pages-neural-cellular-maze-solver/) introduces a method to find a feasible route from the point A to B, when the route exists.

While [a maze can be viewed as a graph](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2019/cmsc132-020X-040X/Project8/proj8.html), we need a method to prove that every graph can be represented as n-dimensional maze.

If then, we can show that Neural Cellular Maze Solver can be applied to an arbitary graph, and network engineers will do the rest of the work to make it work on the real network.

# Goal
The final goal of this project is to make use of maze-solving Cellular Automata to build a program finding a feasible route from point A to B on the quantum network.

# Current Status
As of the point the commit with this sentence was pushed, the project is in the stage of very beginning.

TODO: Our first job is to build a simple code to reproduce the maze-solving technique in a random 2D maze. We start from there.
